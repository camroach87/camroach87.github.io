      <description>Caveat Emptor!: This is a work in progress! I’m refactoring the original code I wrote. Trying to find a nice balance between wrapping functions up in the gefcom2017 package and using existing R packages such as purrr. This post has been uploaded early so I can include a link in the paper.
Introduction This post shows how to implement the model I propose in the paper “Reconciled boosted models for GEFCom2017 hierarchical probabilistic load forecasting”.</description>

      <description>Despite appearing fairly innocuous, loading data can be one of the most frustrating challenges when starting a data science project. Missing values, trailing commas, renegade quotes in strings and many other issues can all cause headaches when reading a csv file. I’m sure many an aspiring data scientist has been left feeling discouraged after falling at this early hurdle - I know I have.
This post introduces some basics of loading data using a csv.</description>

      <description>This series of blog posts gives a brief introduction to R’s tidyverse. The tidyverse is a fantastic framework for shaping, exploring and visualising data. Consistent syntax, intuitive behaviour and excellent performance are the main reasons to learn this set of tools. Furthermore, tidyverse packages have stickers that may be assembled into a geometrically pleasing hex formation.
 Figure 1: I’ll never stop.  Structure Each of the key tidyverse packages will be introduced in a separate post.</description>

      <description>Many of my friends and colleagues in the data science world maintain blogs. Research, insights and tutorials are frequently posted which I often benefit from. I’m always amazed by the talent and generosity of others in this field. The open source communities of R and Python are quite special.
This blog is my attempt to give something back. My background is in probability and statistics though I do not consider myself much of a mathematician.</description>
