      <description>Loading data can be the most innocuous and frustrating challenge when doing data science. Missing values, trailing commas, additional quotes and commas in strings and many other issues can all cause issues.
This post assumes that you’ve managed to get your data into a reasonable format. The above points are a good place to start if you’re having issues. If you can’t work out why your data won’t load always try viewing it in a text editor such as Notepad++ or Atom.</description>

      <description>Many of my friends and colleagues in the data science world maintain blogs. Research, insights and tutorials are frequently posted which I often benefit from. I’m always amazed by the talent and generosity of others in this field. The open source communities of R and Python are quite special.
This blog is my attempt to give something back. My background is in probability and statistics though I do not consider myself much of a mathematician.</description>
