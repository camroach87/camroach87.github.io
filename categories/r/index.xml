      <description>Update (21/10/2017): This is all under construction atm. Rewriting this post and figuring out some syntax highlighting issues.
Despite appearing fairly innocuous, loading data can be one of the most frustrating challenges when starting a data science project. Missing values, trailing commas, superfluous quotes in strings and many other issues can all cause headaches when reading a csv file. I’m sure many an aspiring data scientist has been left feeling discouraged after falling at this early hurdle - I know I have.</description>

      <description>Many of my friends and colleagues in the data science world maintain blogs. Research, insights and tutorials are frequently posted which I often benefit from. I’m always amazed by the talent and generosity of others in this field. The open source communities of R and Python are quite special.
This blog is my attempt to give something back. My background is in probability and statistics though I do not consider myself much of a mathematician.</description>
