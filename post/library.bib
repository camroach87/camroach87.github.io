  abstract = "Understanding the impact of building characteristics on
              electricity demand is important for policy and management
              decision making. Certain building characteristics and equipment
              may increase or decrease electricity consumption. Due to
              different operating practices, these impacts on electricity
              consumption may vary both across the day and across seasons.
              Quantifying the magnitude and statistical significance of these
              impacts will help managers and policy makers make better informed
              decisions. Here we present a mixed effects model to assess the
              importance of several variables on building electricity
              consumption. We use smart meter and building attribute data for
              129 commercial office buildings. Our building attribute data
              includes information on installed equipment and meter
              characteristics of each building. To account for uncertainty in
              both variable significance and model selection we follow a
              multimodel inference approach. Demand impact profiles that show
              the expected change in electricity demand when a characteristic
              is absent or present are produced for each season. A discussion
              of the commercial office building characteristics we use and
              their impact on the daily profile of electricity demand is
              presented. Our approach has the advantage of only requiring
              building level demand and characteristic data. No equipment level
              sub-metering is required. Furthermore, our approach can also be
              used to quantify changes in electricity consumption caused by
              other factors that do not directly draw electricity from the
              grid, such as management decisions or occupant behaviour. We
              conclude with a discussion of applications for our methodology
              and future research directions.",

              probabilistic load forecasting",
  author   = "Roach, Cameron",
  abstract = "When forecasting time series in a hierarchical configuration, it
              is necessary to ensure that the forecasts reconcile at all
              levels. The 2017 Global Energy Forecasting Competition
              (GEFCom2017) focused on addressing this topic. Quantile forecasts
              for eight zones and two aggregated zones in New England were
              required for every hour of a future month. This paper presents a
              new methodology for forecasting quantiles in a hierarchy which
              outperforms a commonly-used benchmark model. A simulation-based
              approach was used to generate demand forecasts. Adjustments were
              made to each of the demand simulations to ensure that all zonal
              forecasts reconciled appropriately, and a weighted reconciliation
              approach was implemented to ensure that the bottom-level zonal
              forecasts summed correctly to the aggregated zonal forecasts. We
              show that reconciling in this manner improves the forecast
              accuracy. A discussion of the results and modelling performances
              is presented, and brief reviews of hierarchical time series
              forecasting and gradient boosting are also included.",
