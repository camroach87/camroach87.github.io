  abstract = "When forecasting time series in a hierarchical configuration, it
              is necessary to ensure that the forecasts reconcile at all
              levels. The 2017 Global Energy Forecasting Competition
              (GEFCom2017) focused on addressing this topic. Quantile forecasts
              for eight zones and two aggregated zones in New England were
              required for every hour of a future month. This paper presents a
              new methodology for forecasting quantiles in a hierarchy which
              outperforms a commonly-used benchmark model. A simulation-based
              approach was used to generate demand forecasts. Adjustments were
              made to each of the demand simulations to ensure that all zonal
              forecasts reconciled appropriately, and a weighted reconciliation
              approach was implemented to ensure that the bottom-level zonal
              forecasts summed correctly to the aggregated zonal forecasts. We
              show that reconciling in this manner improves the forecast
              accuracy. A discussion of the results and modelling performances
              is presented, and brief reviews of hierarchical time series
              forecasting and gradient boosting are also included.",
