      <description>A lot of my friends and colleagues in the data science world maintain blogs. Research, insights and tutorials are frequently posted which I often benefit from. Iâ€™m always amazed by the talent and generosity of others in this field. The open source communities of R and Python are quite special.
This blog is my attempt to give something back. My background is in probability and statistics though I do not consider myself much of a mathematician.</description>
